                <h1>Why Do Snails Matter?</h1>
                <p class="matterpara">So Why the Snail? The reason for the snail is when we, as the current generation, raising the future generation, teach people to be aware of something as minute and minuscule as the humble snail, we teach them responsibility for the earth. We teach them the natural order of how things work and try to place ourselves within that circle of life so as to be progressive in our lives while being progressive with our sustainability. We are stewards of this earth and are naturally given the responsibility to replace what we take-- therefore, let us learn about what to do when we find a snail.
                <br><br/>
                Snails have their place in the circle of life-- they eat parts of your garden, they create nutrients for the soil, they are a fantastic source of protein and calcium, they are nearly extinct, and they are our friends in need. Let us learn together about snails and how we can help them so we can ultimately help the earth.
                <br><br/>
                A quick few factoids on snails: Did you know that snails are a key component to decomposing forest elements and providing calcium for the soil? Bam, now you do. Did you know that snails are important environmental indicators and biodiversity predictors and play a role in the monitoring of climate change? Bam, now you do. And did you know that there is a significant amount of snail species that are endangered? Bam, now you do.
