                <h1>Environmental Stewardship</h1>
                <p class="enviropara">Environmental Preservation With growing climate change and the need for rich soil to sustain our foot patterns, snails have become a strong indicator of whether we are succeeding at maintaining the environment or doing more damage. Snails are our friends, snails are our protectors, snails need our help. Our environmental preservation depends solely on the individual effort of a combined effort in any way possible, and our goal is to reach out to your inner-child and remind you of your snail friends you had on rainy days (and hopefully didn't pour salt on). Our world is hurting and needs some serious attention to its betterment.
                <br><br/>
                When people say "we need to save the earth!" they often forgo the following question: "How? and how can I personally do that?" So much depends on our individually combined effort and it's difficult to break it down into a one-size-fits-all equation for everyone. Some are less capable of running off to California and developing a desalination system than others. Some literally don't have the financial capabilities of buying an electric car or field of solar panels to power their home. Some people barely make it by on their highly-processed food that takes a refinery to pump out. The fact of the matter is we need to find universal ground for each person to become sustainable again. We need to break it down to something each person can quantify in their lives.</p>
