        Intro to Snail Mail

        You may be asking yourself the following question: why snails? Why would anyone devote a website to facts about snails and the environment? I'll answer your question by asking you a question in return: why wouldn't anyone devote a website to facts about snails and the environment?
      </p>  
      <p>
        This website will provide you with a number of different facts about snails, ranging from how to take care of them, what to do if they become a pest, and what you can do to prevent the loss of another beloved species. The information provided on this website will be purely informative and up to your own interpretation of what you will do with said factoids. The overarching goal, of course, is environmental preservation, but seeing that we need to break it down to bite-sized pieces, we are going to start with something that is literally bite-sized: snails.

      <h3>Why Do Snails Matter?</h3>
      <p>
        So Why the Snail?

        The  reason for the snail is when we, as the current generation, raising the future generation, teach people to be aware of something as minute and minuscule as the humble snail, we teach them responsibility for the earth. We teach them the natural order of how things work and try to place ourselves within that circle of life so as to be progressive in our lives while being progressive with our sustainability. We are stewards of this earth and are naturally given the responsibility to replace what we take-- therefore, let us learn about what to do when we find a snail. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Snails have their place in the circle of life-- they eat parts of your garden, they create nutrients for the soil, they are a fantastic source of protein and calcium, they are nearly extinct, and they are our friends in need. Let us learn together about snails and how we can help them so we can ultimately help the earth.
      </p>  
        
        
      <p> 
        A quick few factoids on snails: Did you know that snails are a key component to decomposing forest elements and providing calcium for the soil? Bam, now you do. Did you know that snails are important environmental indicators and biodiversity predictors and play a role in the monitoring of climate change? Bam, now you do. And did you know that there is a significant amount of snail species that are endangered? Bam, now you do.

      <h3>Environmental Stewardship</h3>
      <p>
        Environmental Preservation

        With growing climate change and the need for rich soil to sustain our foot patterns, snails have become a strong indicator of whether we are succeeding at maintaining the environment or doing more damage. Snails are our friends, snails are our protectors, snails need our help.
        
        Our environmental preservation depends solely on the individual effort of a combined effort in any way possible, and our goal is to reach out to your inner-child and remind you of your snail friends you had on rainy days (and hopefully didn't pour salt on). Our world is hurting and needs some serious attention to its betterment. 
      </p>  
      <p> 
        When people say "we need to save the earth!" they often forgo the following question: "How? and how can I personally do that?" So much depends on our individually combined effort and it's difficult to break it down into a one-size-fits-all equation for everyone. Some are less capable of running off to California and developing a desalination system than others. Some literally don't have the financial capabilities of buying an electric car or field of solar panels to power their home. Some people barely make it by on their highly-processed food that takes a refinery to pump out. The fact of the matter is we need to find universal ground for each person to become sustainable again. We need to break it down to something each person can quantify in their lives.
