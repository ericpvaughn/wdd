    <p>Hi there.
        My name is Eric Vaughn-- I'm a web design and development major in my Junior year, 
        trying to plug out as many courses as I can. I'm currently living in Utah and have 
        been married for a little over a year and a half, my wife is expecting (and 
        coincidentally my sugar mama as she has the salary job while I'm still schooling).</p>

    <p>I like cooking food, eating food, watching TV shows about food, and dreaming about 
        (you guessed It) food. I also have a keen interest in mountain biking, celloing, 
        hiking, eating, sitting, and tennising. I find it all quite funning.Â </p>

    <p>I plan on becoming a UX/UI designer who works 100% remote and promptly leave the
         western US so I can see some trees or something (or avoid anyone named Jathan).
         I hope to use what I learn in this course to do exactly that.</p>

    <p>I have been a member of the Church for all my life and love all things related
         to understanding who we are as individuals. Moses 1:39 is my favorite verse.
